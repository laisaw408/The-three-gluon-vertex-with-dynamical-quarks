# The-three-gluon-vertex-with-dynamical-quarks
This repository contains the data for the four form factors of the transversely projected three-gluon vertex, obtained from the Schwinger–Dyson equation (SDE) of this vertex within the 3PI effective-action formalism. Specifically, we have solved the SDE in the presence of two light degenerate quark flavors, using as input the quark, gluon, and ghost propagators, as well as the quark–gluon and ghost–gluon vertices form factors.

The file ' ' available here consists of the data for the four form factors, $ G_i$, with $i=1,2,3,4$, where $ G_i$ are arrays of the form Gi(nxx,nxx,nth), with nxx=30 and nth=20.
